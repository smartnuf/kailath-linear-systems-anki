Why do polynomial matrices appear in system theory?	They encode multivariable linear dynamics algebraically.	Needed for zero and factorization theory.	9	9.1	ch9 core motivation	
What is a unimodular matrix?	A polynomial matrix with a polynomial inverse.	Represents change of basis over a ring.	9	9.2	ch9 core unimodular	
Why are unimodular transformations important?	They preserve essential input–output structure.	Used in Smith and Smith–McMillan forms.	9	9.2	ch9 core invariance	
What is the Smith normal form?	A diagonal form of a polynomial matrix under unimodular equivalence.	Reveals invariant factors.	9	9.3	ch9 core smith	
What does Smith–McMillan form generalize?	Smith form for rational matrices.	Classifies poles and zeros structurally.	9	9.4	ch9 core smith-mcmillan	
Why does Smith–McMillan form matter?	It defines the McMillan degree and transmission zeros.	Central invariant of transfer matrices.	9	9.4	ch9 core invariants	
⚠️ Why is this not linear algebra over a field?	Polynomial matrices form modules over rings.	Vector-space intuition breaks down.	9	9.x	ch9 danger modules	
What does 'unimodular' mean for a polynomial matrix?	It has a polynomial inverse (equivalently, its determinant is a nonzero constant).	Unimodular transformations are the ring-analogue of change-of-basis matrices.	9	9.2	ch9 core unimodular index	
What does the Smith normal form reveal?	Invariant factors of a polynomial matrix under unimodular equivalence.	These invariants generalize gcd structure to matrices.	9	9.3	ch9 core smith index	
How does Smith–McMillan form extend Smith form?	It diagonalizes a rational matrix into ratios of polynomials, revealing pole/zero structure invariantly.	Defines transmission zeros/poles and McMillan degree.	9	9.4	ch9 core smith-mcmillan index	
Why does module language appear here (preview)?	Polynomial matrices act on free modules over a ring, not vector spaces over a field.	Unimodular equivalence is module isomorphism, not similarity.	9	9.x	ch9 preview modules index
