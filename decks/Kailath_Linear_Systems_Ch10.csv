What are system zeros?	Frequencies where input cannot affect output.	Distinct from poles.	10	10.1	ch10 core zeros	
What are transmission zeros?	Zeros of the transfer matrix that block signal transmission.	Defined invariantly.	10	10.1	ch10 core transmission-zeros	
How do zeros relate to invariant subspaces?	Zeros correspond to internal structure decoupled from I/O.	Revealed by Smith–McMillan form.	10	10.2	ch10 core structure	
Why are zeros important for control and synthesis?	They constrain achievable dynamics and feedback.	Cannot be moved arbitrarily.	10	10.3	ch10 core significance	
Why are zeros critical in passive networks?	They correspond to resonance and blocking phenomena.	Linked to physical realizability.	10	10.x	ch10 pr-link	
⚠️ Why are zeros often misunderstood?	They are not simply numerator roots.	They are structural invariants.	10	10.x	ch10 danger zeros	
What are transmission poles and transmission zeros (high level)?	Invariants of a transfer matrix describing frequencies of transmission resonance (poles) and blocking (zeros).	Captured neatly by Smith–McMillan form.	10	10.x	ch10 core transmission poles-zeros index	
⚠️ Why are transmission zeros not just numerator roots in MIMO?	They depend on the matrix structure and unimodular equivalence, not entrywise simplification.	Use Smith–McMillan invariants.	10	10.x	ch10 danger transmission zeros index
