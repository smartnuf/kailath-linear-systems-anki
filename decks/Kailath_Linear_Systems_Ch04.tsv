What does controllability mean?	The ability to steer the state to any point using admissible inputs.	Property of the realization, not the transfer function alone.	4	4.1	ch4 core controllability	
What does observability mean?	The ability to reconstruct the state from output measurements.	Dual to controllability.	4	4.1	ch4 core observability	
Why are controllability and observability structural?	They are invariant under similarity transformations.	Depend on rank conditions.	4	4.2	ch4 core structure	
What does the Kalman decomposition achieve?	It separates the state into controllable/observable subspaces.	Foundation for minimality.	4	4.3	ch4 core kalman	
⚠️ Why can a system be controllable but not observable?	Input reachability does not imply output visibility.	Independent properties.	4	4.x	ch4 danger
