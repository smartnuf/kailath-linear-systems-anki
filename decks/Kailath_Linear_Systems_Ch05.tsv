What is a minimal realization?	A realization that is both controllable and observable.	Minimal dimension among all realizations.	5	5.1	ch5 core minimality	
Why is minimality unique up to similarity?	All minimal realizations of a given transfer function are similar.	Dimension is an invariant.	5	5.2	ch5 core uniqueness	
What does minimality exclude?	Uncontrollable or unobservable state components.	Removes dynamical redundancy.	5	5.1	ch5 core exclusion	
How does minimality relate to McMillan degree?	They are equal for rational transfer functions.	Bridges algebraic and state-space views.	5	5.3	ch5 core mcmillan	
⚠️ Why is minimality not sufficient for passive realizability?	Passivity imposes additional inequality constraints.	Motivates Brune synthesis.	5	5.x	ch5 danger pr-link
