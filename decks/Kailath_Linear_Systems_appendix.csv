Why are appendices important in Kailath?	They contain algebraic tools used implicitly in the main text.	Often skipped but foundational.	A	A.1	app motivation	
What is coprimeness of polynomials?	Polynomials with no common factors.	Crucial for cancellation arguments.	A	A.2	app core coprime	
Why does coprimeness matter in realization theory?	It distinguishes true dynamics from cancelled artifacts.	Used in minimality proofs.	A	A.2	app realization	
What is a module (preview)?	A generalization of vector spaces over rings.	Polynomial matrices act on modules.	A	A.3	app preview modules	
⚠️ Why does module theory matter here?	Many invariants live over rings, not fields.	Linear algebra intuition must be extended.	A	A.x	app danger modules
